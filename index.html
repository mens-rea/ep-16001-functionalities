            <!-- start of lipsum list -->
            <li>But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted</li>
            <li>  She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes</li>
            <li>  So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length</li>
            <li>  She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot</li>
            <li> The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so</li>
            <li> The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, "Give me back my shoe!" "I will not," retorted the Witch, "for it is now my shoe, and not yours</li>
            <li>" "You are a wicked creature!" cried Dorothy</li>
            <li>  "You have no right to take my shoe from me</li>
            <li>" "I shall keep it, just the same," said the Witch, laughing at her, "and someday I shall get the other one from you, too</li>
            <li>" This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot</li>
            <li> Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away</li>
            <li> "See what you have done!" she screamed</li>
            <li>  "In a minute I shall melt away</li>
            <li>" "I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes</li>
            <li> "Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice</li>
            <li> "Of course not," answered Dorothy</li>
            <li>  "How should I?" "Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself</li>
            <li>  I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds</li>
            <li>  Look out--here I go!" With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor</li>
            <li>  Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess</li>
            <li>  She then swept it all out the door</li>
            <li>  After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again</li>
            <li>  Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land</li>
            <li> The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free</li>
            <li>  They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves</li>
            <li> There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty</li>
            <li>  They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing</li>
            <li> "If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us," said the Lion, "I should be quite happy</li>
            <li>" "Don't you suppose we could rescue them?" asked the girl anxiously</li>
            <li> "We can try," answered the Lion</li>
            <li> So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage</li>
            <li>  So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away</li>
            <li>  They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent</li>
            <li>  His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short</li>
